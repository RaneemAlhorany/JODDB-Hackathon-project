# JODDB-Hackathon-project

JODDB Manufacturing Process Management System (Sample Project)
Project Overview
This repository contains a sample project representing a simulated manufacturing company's operating and management system called JODDB

All data used in this project is experimental/sample data, created for demonstration and learning purposes only it does not represent any actual company or business data

This project aims to demonstrate a complete operational structure that manages, tracks, and analyzes the production process from start to finish, illustrating the integration of dashboards and performance analytics

System Objectives

Demonstrate how workflows are organized between the production, quality, and testing departments

Simulate the tracking of each part's progress through the production cycle

Demonstrate the supervisor approval workflow and project validation processes

Provide sample dashboards for real-time monitoring, performance analysis, and project tracking

Display productivity and efficiency reports in a factory like environment

Department Descriptions
Production Department
Represents manual operations and assembly processes (subassemblies, troubleshooting, and operations)

Each employee selects a simulated item and starts a timer to measure the task duration

Upon completion, the simulated data is presented to the supervisor for approval

Quality and Testing Sections
Testing Section: Simulates inspection and feedback processes on manufactured items

Quality Section: Demonstrates the processes for reviewing, repairing, or rejecting items based on inspection results

All processes are linked through workflow templates to ensure traceability

Supervisor
Reviews and approves the simulations

If a task is rejected, the related processes are reset for demonstration purposes in the data flow

Planner
Displays all sample dashboards, monitors key performance indicators (KPIs), and compares planned and actual completion times using demonstration data

Dashboard Overview
1. Project General Dashboard

Displays the total number of simulated orders and their statuses (active, completed, pending)

Project progress rates are displayed using simulated experimental values

Expected timeframes are compared to actual timeframes (based on experimental time data)

Process accuracy and key performance indicators are visualized

2. Employee Dashboard

Lists employees, their roles, teams, and supervisors (all simulated)

Displays sample attendance and productivity metrics

Shows utilization, productivity, and efficiency calculations using experimental data

Includes graphs to compare employee performance

3. Project Details Dashboard

Provides an example of project tracking

Visualizes task completion rates for each project using experimental metrics

Includes experimental graphs of

Project progress status

Successful vs. failed vs. re examined processes

Daily completion trends represented by experimental values

Database Structure
Note: The database used here contains only sample/simulated data no real data or confidential information

This sample database demonstrates how to organize and connect various entities within a production management system, including

Employees
Projects
Processes
Quality Checks
Time Tracking
Performance Metrics
These metrics are used solely to illustrate data flow concepts and dashboard integration

Key Features and Benefits (Demo)
Simulates the complete manufacturing workflow from production to quality control

Tracks processes and approvals step-by-step through the demo processes

Provides interactive dashboards for visualization and analysis

Demonstrates how to measure performance and efficiency in a factory model

Forms a foundation for building realistic manufacturing management systems

Future Enhancements
Integrates real time data sources (for actual deployment scenarios)

Adds automated notifications for delays, quality issues, or defects
Implements AI powered forecasting models to improve efficiency and delivery planning

Integrates with inventory and procurement systems for a complete manufacturing solution

Additional Information
All data, metrics, and examples shown are 100% based on samples

This project is for demonstration, learning, and presentation purposes only. It does not include any factual information about the company, confidential records, or production metrics
